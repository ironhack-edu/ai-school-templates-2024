<!-- # LAB | Figma: Component Properties and Variants -->

## Learning Goals
- Explain what are components properties and how to use them
- Apply properties to your components to reflect their different states
- Build interactive components and prototype interactions between variants

<br>

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use component properties and variants in Figma. You will apply properties to your components to reflect their different states and build interactive components. You will also prototype interactions between components and their variants.

<br>

## Requirements

- Complete the Figma lab.
- Submit the link to your Figma project in the student portal.
