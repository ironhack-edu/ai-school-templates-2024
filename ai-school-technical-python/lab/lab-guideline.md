# Lab

A lab is a practice activity consisting of several exercises, referred to as iterations or tasks, that are designed to help students reinforce what they learned in class (and potentially some days before). Labs are formative assessments and the goal is for students to gain skills and for the instructional team to get an understanding of their progress. Labs are checked only for submission and students will not get individual (personalized) feedback. Labs can be reviewed during the week or the following week  - or at least the most challenging labs should be reviewed with students (this is a good time for TA(s) to take the lead and also to engage students in reviewing their work).





## Types of labs

- lab for a day
- lab for a week (or multiple days) - where students go and, in phases, build a piece of something every day to have the full "app" (or mini-project) by the end of the week.
    - The risk: If a student doesn't complete some of the steps, they are not able to move forward and work on the next one, which usually causes frustration.
    



ðŸ™Œ Hint: Some labs start from scratch, and some could start from the starter code provided.
