# Lesson

- Instructor-led session when new concepts are being introduced. This time should be as much as possible practical, and the least possible theoretical. An instructor will  demo and they could ask students to code-along if that would give the most value or to watch-and-learn (in which case there needs to be CFU much more often to make sure students are grasping the materials.)
- **"I DO" / Demo** - Typical old-fashioned lectures are mostly replaced with code-along, demonstrations and could include also collaborative activities led by an instructor.
- Should be timed - perfect to spend 25-30 min on each lesson. After the lesson, there should be Check For Understanding (activity).
