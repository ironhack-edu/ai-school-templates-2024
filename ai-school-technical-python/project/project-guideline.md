## Project

- Typically group activities that span 1-2 weeks. Projects often feature at the end of a module and allow students to build something that covers learning outcomes from the entire module. Students are required to present their project to the class and are assessed by the teaching team to verify that they have met the project requirements and learning outcomes.

## Project Kick-off

- Project Kick-off is session where the instructor introduces students to the project that they will be working on (typically at the end of a module). This includes talking through the brief and project requirements, the necessary milestones, examples and references, guides, useful resources and answering any questions students may have. During this session the instructor may also discuss the rubric for the project so students understand the evaluation criteria.
